# ESSENTIALISM
personal productivity tool

Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. Less but better.


The Essentialist approach:

Explore and Evaluate: spend as much time as possible exploring, listening, debating, questioning, and thinking.

Exploration is not an end in itself, but a way to discern the vital few from the trivial many


Eliminate: actively eliminate activities and efforts that donâ€™t make the highest possible contribution


Execute: invest the time you saved into creating a system for removing obstacles and making execution as easy as possible
